JS230 DOM and Asynchronous Programming with JavaScript
Lesson 1 | Practice Problems - A Hierarchy of Nodes

// Q1
False, the mapping between the tags that appear in an HTML file and the nodes
in the DOM is NOT directly one-to-one. 

The DOM will always attempt to correct mistakes found in the HTML file. As 
such, an HTML file where one of the elements has a missing enclosing tag will 
appear to have one in the browser as per the DOM. 

In addition, the DOM could have nodes for text and whitespace that are not 
necessarily specified in HTML files.


// Q2
True, text nodes can sometimes contain nothing but whitespace. These type of
nodes are called "empty nodes." These nodes represent the gap/newline between
the elements in the HTML markup. However, these empty nodes are not visible in
the HTML.
