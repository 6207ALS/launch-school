// Q1
const PROCESS = require('process');

let args = PROCESS.argv;
let command = args[2];


On line 7, 'args' variable is declared and initialized with the the 
PROCESS object's 'argv' property. The 'argv' property is an array containing the
command-line arguments passed when the Node.js process is launched. According to
documentations, 'The first element will be 'process.execPath'. The second
element will be the path to the JavaScript file being executed. The remaining
elements will be any additional command-line arguments.' 

As such, any element beyond the second element will be arguments entered by the 
user. On line 8, the 'command' variable is declared and initialized with 
the third element of the 'argvs' array. It is used to determine if any 
additional arguments were passed from the command-line interface.
