// JS185 Lesson 2: Adding Expenses - Practice Problem


// Q1 - Can you see any potential issues with the Solution code above?

One potential issue is the fact that any reserved or unsafe characters from the
user's arguments are not escaped. For instance, suppose the user passed in
"Gas money for Karen's Car" as the 'memo' argument for the 'add' command. In
SQL, single-quote characters must be escaped with an additional single quote, or
an error is raised: 

(node:7040) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection 
(rejection id: 1): error: syntax error at or near "s"

In the text shown above, the error states that the Promise object used to 
query with PostgreSQL was rejected. The application, at its current state, is 
not capable of handling rejected Promise objects. In addition, the error states 
that the cause of the error is due to a syntax error near the "s" character, 
which hints at the unescaped single-quote.
