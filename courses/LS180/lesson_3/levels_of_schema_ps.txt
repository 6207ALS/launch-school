// Database Diagrams: Levels of Schema Practice Problems


// Q1, Q2, Q3
The three levels of database schema are conceptual, logical, and physical.
A conceptual database schema concerns with high-level abstractions of the data.
It demonstrates the relationships between the 'entities' of the databases. A
physical database schema, on the other hand, concerns with lower-level, 
implementation-specific diagrams of the database. It displays detailed
diagrams of each table such as their columns and attributes. A logical schema
is a combination of the two - conceptual and physical. The schema will often
contain a list of all the attributes and their data types, but in a way that
is not specific to a database.


// Q4
The three types of relationships that entities / tables can have with each other
are 'one-to-one', 'one-to-many', and 'many-to-many'.
