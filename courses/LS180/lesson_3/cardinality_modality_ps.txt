// LS180 - Lesson 3, Database Diagrams: Cardinality and Modality Practice Problems


// Q1
Cardinality refers to the different types of relationships entities within a
datatbase can have with each other. Specifically, it refers to the number of
objects on each side of the relationship. These relationships are determined as
'One-to-One', 'One-to-Many', and 'Many-to-Many'.


// Q2
Modality determines if the relationship between two entities is 'required' or
'optional'. If the relationship is required, at least one instance of the entity
is required. On the contrary, if the relationship is optional, an instance of
the entity is not required for the relationship to exist. In other words, 
modality is referred as the 'lower bound' on how many instances there can be in
a relationship.


// Q3
As modality of relationship determines how many instances are required in a 
relationship, a modality of one would indicate that at least one instance is 
required. 


// Q4
Crow's foot notation was covered in the video. Crow's foot notation signifies
both the cardinality and modality between two entities of a relationship. It
determines if the cardinality is 'One-to-One', 'One-to-Many', or 'Many-to-Many'
as well as if the modality is 'required' or 'optional'.
