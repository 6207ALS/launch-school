// LS180 - Lesson 2: PostgreSQL Data Types, Practice Problems

// Q1

The difference between 'varchar' and 'text' is the number of characters that can
be provided for the value. For 'varchar,' there is a predefined number of
characters allowed for the value. For instance, a datatype of varchar(25) would
accept up to 25 characters as its value. As such, a value like
'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy' would be valid but not 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
The 'text' data type, on the other hand, accepts an unlimited number of
characters. A string of theoretically any length is valid as the value.

// Q2

'integer' values are non-fractional numbers. 'real' values are floating-point
numbers that accept fractional values. 'decimal' values can contain non-floating
point fractional values with a limited precision.

// Q3

The largest value that an 'integer' column can store is 2147483647 
(or (2 ^ 32) - 1).

// Q4

A 'timestamp' value includes a date and a time of day, while a 'date' only 
includes the date (and no time).

// Q5

No. A timestamp cannot store the time zone of its value. However, a 'timestamp
with time zone' data type exists that will store a timestamp with a time zone.
