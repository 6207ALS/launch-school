JS170 Lesson 3 - Practice Problems: The Request Response Cycle

// Q1
The required components of an HTTP request are the request method, host name,  
and the path. Optional components include parameters, other headers, and message
body.

// Q2
The required component of an HTTP response is the status code. The headers and
body are optional.

// Q3
Several factors determine if a request should use GET or POST as its HTTP 
method. The request should assess the parameters that are passed to the request.
If the parameter contains sensitive information and should not be passed as 
values of the URL's query string, then a POST method should be used. Further,
if the amount of information exceeds the amount a query string allows, then a 
POST method should be used.

GET requests should only retrieve content from the server, and should be thought
of as "read only" operations. POST requests involve changing values that are
stored on the server. A notable example is HTML forms that use POST requests to
send the provided information to the server.
