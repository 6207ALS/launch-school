LS202 HTML & CSS | Lesson 6 - Guided Project: Flex

// Q1
Going from top to bottom, here are the initial thoughts on formatting the file:

1. The navigation bar must be converted into a horizontal bar. That is, the
individual links should be displayed side-by-side, not vertically.

2. The components of the main section (two green containers and white container)
should also be displayed side-by-side, not vertically. Also, the white 
container, being the main content of the page, should have larger width than 
the two green containers.

3. The components of the footer (the airplane image and copyright statement) 
should also be displayed side-by-side. The image should be as tall as the
copyright statement.

Some other notes include:
  - There appears to be margins/padding placed on the elements. They should be
    removed

  - The airplane image is placed within an orange container. That should be
    considered when placing the image and copyright statement together.


// Q2
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

Every element was stripped to 0-margin and 0-padding to remove any default
styles.
