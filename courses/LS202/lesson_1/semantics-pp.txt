LS202 HTML and CSS | Lesson 1: Semantics - Practice Problems

// Q1
Semantic tags:
<article>
<aside>
<b>
<footer>
<h3>
<header>
<section>
<strong>

Non-semantic tags:
<div>
<span>

// Q2
The most suitable tag for the provided content would be the <article> tag. The
grouped content are all related (thematic) and, overall, can be understood
without any additional context. It is self-contained and resuable.

However, the answer is contingent. Semantics depend on the context and intent 
of the overall HTML file. The content can be considered a <section> or <aside> 
depending on its surrounding content.

// Q3
The <blockquote> tag is a possible alternative for <sometag>. The <blockquote> 
tag is used to indicate that the enclosed text is an extended quotation of 
another source. The <address> tag, on the other hand, indicates that the nested 
content is contact information for a person, organization, location, etc. The 
content — an extended quote of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address — should rather be
nested in a <blockquote> tag. Though, <article> is still a suitable tag for the
content.

// Q4
A <section> tag may be the best replacement for <sometag>. The text appears to 
be part of a larger body of work, but it cannot be a standalone block like an 
article. It is also not an aside since it appears to be part of the main 
document flow.
Again, semantics depend on the content and intent. It is possible to argue for a
different answer.

// Q5
The content within <sometag> appears as an additional comment, rather than part
of the main text. In this case, the <aside> tag can be used to replace 
<sometag>. Again, the answer is contingent to the context and intent of the
HTML file.
