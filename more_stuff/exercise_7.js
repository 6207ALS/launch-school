/*
What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

Exception handling refers to dealing with program errors in a manageable,
predictable way. It means preemptively dealing with errors before the program
chooses to end. This means if a program happens to throw an error, and
is coded to handle such error (notably through the try/catch statement), it
will run an alternative body of code instead of ending the program. It 
additionally allows programmers to pinpoint where a bug exists within
a body of code.
