// LS180 - SQL Fundamentals: Easy 1, Add Constraint

A: ALTER TABLE birds
ADD CHECK (age > 0);

To ensure that only birds with a positive age are added to the database, a
constraint can be added to the table. First, we specify which table we wish to
alter (update): birds. We follow the statement with a 'ADD CONSTRAINT' clause to
add a constraint. We provide the 'CHECK' clause with 'age > 0' as the condition.
