// LS180 - SQL Fundamentals: Easy 1, Create a Table

A: Connected to the 'animals' database, the following statement can be entered:
CREATE TABLE birds (
id serial PRIMARY KEY,
name varchar(25),
age integer,
species varchar(15));

'id' is a primary key that auto-increments. The data type 'serial' is an integer
that auto-increments 'id' as we create new 'birds' rows in the table. The 
PRIMARY KEY keywords ensures that 'id' is NOT NULL and UNIQUE. We also define
'name' and 'species' columns as string data types, each with various allocated
memory (string length). Finally, we define the 'age' column with an integer data
type.
