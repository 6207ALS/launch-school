// LS180 - SQL Fundamentals: Easy 1, Drop Database

A: DROP DATABASE animals;

The DROP DATABASE statement can be used to delete an existing table. We follow 
the statement with 'animals' to specify which database we want to delete. It
should be noted that the user must be connected to a different database to
execute the statement. Alternatively, the user can enter the command
'dropdb <database_name>' from the terminal instead of using the 'psql' console.
