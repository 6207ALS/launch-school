LS180 - SQL Fundamentals: DML, DDL, and DCL, DML/DDL/DCL Part 10

The provided statement makes use of the Data Definition Language (DML) 
component of SQL. The "CREATE SEQUENCE" statement alters, modifies a database's

other words, it manipulates a database's structure rather than the data itself. 
As such, 'CREATE SEQUENCE' is considered a DML statement.
