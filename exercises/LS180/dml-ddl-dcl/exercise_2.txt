LS180 - SQL Fundamentals: DML, DDL, and DCL, DML/DDL/DCL Part 2

A:
The provided statement makes use of the Data Manipulation Language (DML) of SQL.
The 'SELECT' DML statement is used to return the 'column_name' column from the
'my_table' table. The 'SELECT' statement queries the specified data in a
databse. In contrast to DDL, which defines the structure of a table, DML
manipulates with the existing data.
