LS180 - SQL Fundamentals: DML, DDL, and DCL, DML/DDL/DCL Part 1

A:

Data Definition Language: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE
Data Manipulation Language: SELECT, INSERT INTO

The two remaining sublanguages of SQL are Data Definition Language (DDL) and
Data Manipulation Language (DML). 

DDL  is used to 'define' the structure, or schema, of databases. The 'CREATE 
TABLE' DDL statement is used to create a new table within a database. 
Expressions provided after the statement define the schema of the table. The 
'ALTER TABLE' DDL statement is used to update and change the structure of a 
table. Expressions provided after the statement define which aspect of the 
table to change. 

DML is used to manipulate and interact with the existing data within databases.
The 'SELECT' DML statement is used to select data from a database, typically 
from table(s). The returned data is stored in a result table, called the 
result-set. The 'INSERT INTO' DML statement is used to add, insert data 
(records) into a specified table. The values required for each column of a row
are typically provided within the statement.
