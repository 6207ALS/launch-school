// LS180 - SQL Fundamentals: DML, Delete Accelerometer

DELETE FROM parts
WHERE device_id = 1;

DELETE FROM devices
WHERE id = 1;

Further Exploration:
To delete both a device and its associated parts with one SQL, the tables,
specifically 'parts', must be configured differently. The 'ON DELETE CASCADE'
clause should be added to the FOREIGN KEY of the 'parts' table. In turn, the
deletion of the associated PRIMARY KEY in the 'devices' table will cause the
associated FOREIGN KEY in the 'parts' table to be deleted as well.
