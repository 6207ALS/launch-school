// Exercise 6 - Member Directory

/*
Caroline manages the member directory of her club and decided to implement a 
program she can use for doing that. Since the club is not very big, it's 
sufficient for her to keep the members' names and phone numbers in an object. 
Later she wants to add functionality that allows her to write this object to a 
file.

One requirement Caroline takes very seriously is input validation. She intended 
for her code to strictly require that only alphabetic letters be included in the 
members' first and last names, separated by a space. But upon making a typo when 
entering the information of the newest member, she realizes that isn't the case.

Figure out why not and fix the code so that it works as expected. You may also 
consider writing a few more test cases to ensure that the input validation 
requirement is properly met.

  'Margaret Asbury': '989-1111',

function isValidName(name) {
  return (/^[a-z]+ [a-z]+$/i).test(name);

function isValidPhone(phone) {
  return (/^\d{3}-\d{4}$/).test(phone);
}

function validMemberInfo(name, phone) {
  return isValidName(name) && isValidPhone(phone);
}

function addMember(name, phone) {
  if (validMemberInfo(name, phone)) {
    memberDirectory[name] = phone;
  } else {
    console.log('Invalid member information.');
  }
}

addMember('Laura Carlisle', '444-2223');
addMember('Rachel Garcia', '232-1191');

console.log(memberDirectory);

/*
The issue with the program was the regex used to validate the names for the
"addMember" function. In the "isValidName" function, the regex used to validate
the name is as follows: /^\w+ \w+$/. The meta-character "\w" represents an
instance of a "word character," which classifies as any letter, digit, or
underscore. This means that names with numbers in them are considered valid.

The solution would be to refactor the regex to (/^[a-z]+ [a-z]+$/i). The [a-z]
character set allows only for alphabetical letters (case-insensitive).
