// Function that takes two numbers and returns their sum

START

# given two numbers

RETURN num1 + num2

END


// Function that takes a list of strings and returns a single string of all the
// strings concatenated

START

# given list of strings

RETURN list.join(' ')

END


// Function that takes an array of integers and returns a new array with every
// other element from the original array, starting with the first element

START

# given an array of integers

SET newArray = []

FOR integer of array  
  IF index is odd
    newArray.push(integer)

RETURN newArray

END


// Function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character
// in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 
// 'axbxcdxex', the function returns 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given 
// character does not occur at least 3 times, return null.

# given a string and a character

END


// Function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging 
// the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the
// even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array 
// should become the elements at the odd indexes.

# given two arrays, arr1 and arr2
