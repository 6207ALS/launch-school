1. Running 'foo.js' with the node command outputs 'bar', the string literal we set to the variable foo.

2. Each line of code, using the node REPL, has its own output. The first line outputs undefined. The second
line logs "bar" to the console, which is the value set to the "foo" variable. The third returns the value of 
the "foo" variable: 'bar". 

3. Unlike the node REPL, the Chrome console REPL does not have an output for every line. Though, it will 
output 'bar' from the console.log statement.
